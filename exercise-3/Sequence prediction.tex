% TASK 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Explain/define: “Transcription Factor Binding Site” and “Position Weight Matrix”.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
\textbf{Transcription Factor (Binding Site)} is a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences, thereby controlling the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA. It is the areas before the gene.
\item
\textbf{A position weight matrix} (PWM), also known as a position-specific weight matrix (PSWM) or position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), is a commonly used representation of motifs (sequence patterns) in biological sequences. The whole matrix is used to to represent the most likely motif sequence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Given are the following 18 binding sequences for a transcription factor.}

\textbf{Compute (1) a position count matrix} 
\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{tabular}{c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | })
  & 0  & 1  & 2  & 3  & 4  & 5  & 6  & 7  & 8  & 9 \\
  \hline
	A & 3  & 3  & 0  & 2  & 5  & 2  & 0  & 1  & 0  & 0 \\
	C & 12 & 15 & 0  & 16 & 13 & 1  & 16 & 15 & 14 & 11 \\
	G & 1  & 0  & 0  & 0  & 0  & 3  & 0  & 2  & 0  & 4 \\
	T & 2  & 0  & 18 & 0  & 0  & 12 & 2  & 0  & 4  & 3 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\item
\textbf{(2) a position weight matrix} 
\begin{table}[!h]
  \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c}
	  & 0 	  & 1     & 2     & 3  	  & 4  & 5  & 6  & 7  & 8  & 9 \\
	\hline
	A & 3/18  & 3/18  & 0/18  & 2/18  & 5/18  & 2/18  & 0/18  & 1/18  & 0/18  & 0/18 \\
	C & 12/18 & 15/18 & 0/18  & 16/18 & 13/18 & 1/18  & 16/18 & 15/18 & 14/18 & 11/18\\
	G & 1/18  & 0/18  & 0/18  & 0/18  & 0/18  & 3/18  & 0/18  & 2/18  & 0/18  & 4/18 \\
	T & 2/18  & 0/18  & 18/18 & 0/18  & 0/18  & 12/18 & 2/18  & 0/18  & 4/18  & 3/18 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Note that each entry should be multiplied by a pseudo number, to avoid having 0's. Having any 0's would cause the probability to be 0, regardless of the other entries.
We should assume the following background distribution of nucleotides.
\begin{verbatim}
A: 0.2 T: 0.2 C: 0.3 G: 0.3
\end{verbatim}
First we multiply the weight (c=4) with each pseudo-number (ex: 4 times 0.2) and then we ADD the pseudo-count to the matrix. Therefore the PWM looks like (todo, its currently \textbf{wrong}):
\begin{table}[!h]
  \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c}
	  & 0  & 1  & 2  & 3  & 4  & 5  & 6  & 7  & 8  & 9 \\
	\hline
	A & 3/18  & 3/18  & 0.2/18  & 2/18  & 5/18  & 2/18  & 0.2/18  & 1/18  & 0.2/18  & 0.2/18 \\
	C & 12/18 & 15/18 & 0.2/18  & 16/18 & 13/18 & 1/18  & 16/18 & 15/18 & 14/18 & 11/18\\
	G & 1/18  & 0.3/18  & 0.3/18  & 0.3/18  & 0.3/18  & 3/18  & 0.3/18  & 2/18  & 0.3/18  & 4/18 \\
	T & 2/18  & 0.3/18  & 18/18 & 0.3/18  & 0.3/18  & 12/18 & 2/18  & 0.3/18  & 4/18  & 3/18 \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
