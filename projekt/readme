INTRODUCTION

REQUIREMENTS
python3
R version 3.1.2
peax & linux to run it

EXECUTION
copy labeled data into 		data/labelled_candy_raw/
copy unlabelled data into 	data/unlabelled_candy_raw/
cd src
./runAll

SOURCE DESCRIPTION
/bin 							directory with peax and yoshiko files, used by peax tool
/data	/labelled_candy_raw 	directory for labeled data
		/unlabelled_candy_rad	directory for unlabelled data

/src 	/densityplot.R 			outputs density plots into /plot/density/
		/peakalign.R 			outputs histograms and peakoutputs into /plot/peaks/
		/random_forest_fold.R 	runs Random Forest classifies with 5-fold cross validation
		/findPeakIds.py 		using Euclidian distances identifies similar (with a certain threshold) peaks and names them with the same id
		/createIndicatorMatrix.py 	creates a density matrix from data given, with samples as rows and peaks as columns
		/make_densityPlots.sh	runs R script for making density plots on all .csv files in a specified folder
		/runAll.sh				uses peax tool to find peaks, and runs the abovementioned programs to: align peaks, create indicator matrix and run the random forest classifier.

EXECUTION RESULTS
/plot	/density				directory with density plots from labelled data
		/peaks 					recreation of plots in the project description (fig. 2)
			/histogram
			/peakoutput
/data	/candy_peax
		/peaks_labelled
		/peaks_unlabelled
		/indicator_matrix_labelled.csv
		/indicator_matrix_unlabelled.csv
